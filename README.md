# classification_geographic_area
In a Kaggle competition aimed at classifying geographical regions into six categories, I designed and fine-tuned a Random Forest model, achieving an impressive F1-score of 0.90 by optimizing hyperparameters and handling class imbalances effectively


The geographical features of the data are:

An irregular polygon.
Categorical values describing the status of the polygon on five different dates (for example, the polygon was under construction on day 1, and construction was completed on the following four dates).
Neighbourhood urban features (e.g., the polygon is in a dense urban and industrial region).
Neighbourhood geographic features (e.g., the polygon is near a river and a hill).
